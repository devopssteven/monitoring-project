# monitoring-project
After learning the key concepts in DevOps &amp; Cloud Computing, I decided to work on a first project. I created my own web app and deployed it on Azure. As my desire to learn increased, I decided to complete a new project, but this time, following the steps from a Youtuber (**Cloud Champ**).
